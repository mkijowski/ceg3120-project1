Link1 summary, link2 summary, link3 summary.  Links 1 and two are a lot of work for a simple assignment so we chose to implement a modified link 3 where we ignore branches entirely and commit directly to jail.  We did not pass go and did not collect $200.  Branches were made solely for the purpose of a grade and were then burned for s'mores.

This is clearly a bad branching strategy that was unable to fully roast a marshmellow without burning it. In the future we would implement xyz.
