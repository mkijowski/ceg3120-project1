In working on issued #14 from https://github.com/gzdwsu/RaiderPlanner/issues/14
I determined the likely cause/ best way to implement was to...

following our branching strategy I cleaned my finger of melted chocolate and created bbranch study-profiles.  The following commits were used to address this issue:
* 2dd8e65        updated readme
* f3fca58        updated readme
* 1def105        added submodule vundle

These commits were done hastily and had no effect on the issue at hand.  In fact it would take several mythical man months to make any sort of progress on this issue.  Without end in sight I decided to issue pull request 44cd99b so that the owner of the fork can deal with this.
